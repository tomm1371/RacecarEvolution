# Racecar Evolution

Welcome to Racecar Evolution! This program simulates the evolution of racecars over time through a genetic algorithm.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the program up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this program, you will need to have the Processing software installed on your computer. Processing is an open-source programming language and development environment. You can download it for free from the following link: [Processing](https://processing.org/download/)

### Running the Program

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the `RacecarEvolution.pde` file using the Processing software
3. Click the run button to start the simulation

## Implementation Details

The code for this program is written in the Processing programming language. The genetic algorithm used to simulate the evolution of the racecars is implemented through a series of mathematical calculations and simulations. The algorithm simply changes the turn angle of the racecars based on weights in the `NeuralNetwork.pde` file.

We hope you enjoy using this program and exploring the exciting world of racecar evolution!
